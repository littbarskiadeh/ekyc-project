# eKYC

## Project Description
eKYC project is a blockchain system for sharing customer KYC information.

The system enables:
• Storing KYC information of a user
• Putting out a request for the KYC of a user
• Responding to the request
• Picking the best response to use ???
• If there are no responses, get the data from the user

## Requirements
Financial institutions are required by law to “Know Your Client” (KYC). This is a requirement that
makes the seller of the securities aware of the financial status of the buyer. It requires the
seller to make sure that the buyer meets certain requirements before buying risky investments
Currently each company has to gather this information from each investor. If an investor deals
with multiple companies, they have to get this information all over again. Companies are also
required to update the KYC information on an annual basis.
